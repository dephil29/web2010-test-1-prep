// Question 2

// Create a function called adventureSelector that takes 1 argument/parameter.
// adventureSelector should return 1 of 2 different anonymous function, based on the
// number that is passed into it.
//
// Each of the two anonymous functions should console.log the following messages:
//
// If the number is 1:
//
//    You selected Harry Potter World!
//
// If the number is 2:
//
//    You're staying home with Mom. Mom can be fun, can't she?
//
// Lastly, test your adventureSelector function by immediately invoking the
// function it returns when you pass it the number 1.

function adventureSelector (num) {
  if (num === 1) {
    return function() {
      console.log("You selected Harry Potter World!");
    };
  }else{
    return function () {
      console.log("You're staying home with Mom. Mom can be fun, can't she?")
    }

  }
}

adventureSelector(2)();
